## Overview

The Passage to Spawner (P2S) is a Bayesian model that produces estimates of spawning adults for `Battle Creek`, `Clear Creek`, `Deer Creek`, and `Mill Creek` with uncertainty. The model can be used to get spawning adults for a tributary as part of any stock-recruit-based SRJPE model alternative.

## Submodel Objective
The purpose of the P2S submodel is to take in observed upstream passage, or escapement, estimates from a tributary and model the relationship with spawner counts, either from redd surveys or holding surveys. The P2S produces estimated spawner counts with uncertainty for use in creating the `stock` portion of a `stock-recruit model` in the SRJPE.

The model also estimates a `conversion rate`, or proportion of adults that pass though the video counting systems that become spawning adults (i.e. prespawn mortality). The P2S can also be used for forecasting; it takes in a standardized environmental covariate and uses this variable to predict spawners from upstream passage counts. In this way, the P2S provides resiliency for years where data may be missing (i.e. years where upstream passage data were collected but spawner surveys were not conducted).

## Conceptual model

P2S estimates adult abundance needed for the stock recruit model. See figure 1 below to see how it fits into the full JPE model system.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("vignettes", "images", "P2S jpe diagram.png"),
                        rel_path = FALSE)
```

## Submodel Architecture

The submodel takes observed data (in orange) and predicts spawner counts (in pink). Parameters estimated by the model are light pink; for more information, see documentation.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("vignettes", "images", "P2S_for_dashboard.png"),
                        rel_path = FALSE)
```

# Model inputs

The model takes in two datasets:

* **Observed adult counts** or estimates from all methods (upstream passage, holding surveys, redd surveys, and carcass surveys) aggregated by year and stream. This is in the `SRJPEdata::observed_adult_input` data object.
* **Observed environmental covariates** aggregated by year within streams, and standardized (scaled to center on 0). This is in the `SRJPEdata::adult_model_covariates_standard` object.

# Running the P2S submodel

## For a given stream and covariate

The model is run for a given stream and environmental covariate.

* Options for streams are `battle creek` and `clear creek`.
* Environmental covariates are `water year type`, `growing degree days`, `maximum flow`, `median passage timing`, and `passage index`.
 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# run the model for battle creek and water year type
battle_inputs <- prepare_P2S_inputs("battle creek", "wy_type")
battle_P2S_model <- run_passage_to_spawner_model(battle_inputs)
```

## For all covariates within a stream

This truncates the dataset to only those years where all covariate data is available. You can look at parameters that help diagnose the performance of the different covariates like `R2_data`, `R2_fixed`, `mean_redds_per_spawner`, and `b1_survival`.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# run the model for battle creek and water year type
battle_covariate_comparison <- compare_P2S_model_covariates("battle creek")

battle_covariate_comparison |> 
  filter(parameter %in% c("R2_data", "R2_fixed", "mean_redds_per_spawner",
                          "sigma_redds_per_spawner", "b1_survival",
                          "spawner_abundance_forecast"))
```


# Model Output

The P2S model produces a STANfit object when run. You can extract parameter estimates from the model object with the function `extract_P2S_estimates()`. This produces a table.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
battle_parameter_estimates <- extract_P2S_estimates(battle_P2S_model)
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(battle_parameter_estimates, 10))
```

## Extract predicted spawners by year, with uncertainty

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
battle_parameter_estimates |>
  filter(parameter == "predicted_spawners") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = `50`)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = `2.5`, ymax = `97.5`), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Predicted Spawner Count",
       title = "Predicted Spawner Count for Battle Creek") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can also see forecasted spawner count for a wet or dry year with uncertainty by looking at the `abundance_forecast` parameters, which use the average upstream passage as a predictor variable and water year type as the predictive covariate. Deer and Mill Creek model fits are limited in utility due to a lack of available data, so the confidence intervals for those tributaries are much greater than for Battle and Clear Creeks.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
forecasts <- battle_parameter_estimates |>
  filter(parameter == "spawner_abundance_forecast") |>
  mutate(pred_index = row_number()) |> 
  mutate(parameter = ifelse(pred_index == 1, "forecast_dry_year", "forecast_wet_year"),
         forecast_level = ifelse(parameter == "forecast_dry_year", "Dry", "Wet"),
         data_type = "forecast")

forecasts |>
  ggplot(aes(x = forecast_level, y = `50`)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = forecast_level, ymin = `2.5`, ymax = `97.5`),
                width = 0.1, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(aes(x = forecast_level, y = `50`,
                 color = forecast_level),
             size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Forecast Type (Wet or Dry)",
       y = "Predicted Spawner Count using \n Across-year Mean Passage",
       title = "Forecasted Spawner Count for Wet and Dry Years") +
  scale_color_manual("Forecast Year Type",
                     values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest1")[2:3]) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        strip.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```
