\arguments{
\item{data}{a list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \strong{number_efficiency_experiments} number of unique mark-recapture experiments performed across tributaries, years and weeks
\item \strong{number_sites_pCap} number of tributaries to use for the pCap component of the model
\item \strong{number_weeks_catch} number of weeks with catch data
\item \strong{number_weeks_with_mark_recapture} number of weeks in catch data with associated pCap and flow data
\item \strong{number_weeks_without_mark_recapture} number of weeks in catch data without associated pCap and flow data
\item \strong{number_weeks_with_catch} number of weeks in catch data with catch data (RST fished)
\item \strong{indices_site_pCap} tributary index (of all possible tributaries) to use to predict efficiency for missing strata. Note length=0 if selected tributary is not part of trib set that has mark-recap data. In this case model that samples from trib hyper will be called.
\item \strong{indices_site_mark_recapture} indices (1:number_sites_pCap) assigned to the mark-recapture experiment table for use in BUGs
\item \strong{indices_pCap} indices of weeks in mark-recapture table for U strata being estimated
\item \strong{indices_without_mark_recapture} indices of weeks in catch data without associated pCap and flow data
\item \strong{indices_with_mark_recapture} indices of weeks in catch data with associated pCap and flow data
\item \strong{indices_with_catch} indices of weeks in catch data with catch data
\item \strong{number_released} number of fish released for each mark-recapture experiment
\item \strong{number_recaptured} number of fish recaptured for each mark-recapture experiment
\item \strong{weekly_catch} weekly abundance
\item \strong{standardized_efficiency_flow} standardized flow, averaged over recapture days (< 1 week)
\item \strong{catch_flow} standardized flow, averaged by week
\item \strong{K} number of columns in the bspline basis matrix
\item \strong{b_spline_matrix} The b_spline_matrix (bspline basis matrix. One row for each data point (1:number_weeks_catch), and one column for each term in the cubic polynomial function (4) + number of knots)
\item \strong{lgN_max} maxmimum possible value for log N across strata

\value{
either a list of the required inputs for a WinBUGS model (if running on a Mac), or the results
of the model run.
